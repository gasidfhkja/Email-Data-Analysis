ANALYSIS: Key Differences Between High vs Low Performing Emails



Subject Line Improvements
Be Specific: Mention the exact benefit (e.g., ‚Äú40% Off Puzzles‚Äù beats ‚ÄúPuzzle Savings‚Äù).
Create Urgency ‚Äî But Authentically: Use terms like ‚ÄúEarly Access‚Äù, ‚ÄúToday Only‚Äù, but avoid overused phrases like ‚ÄúLast Chance‚Äù unless it's truly final.
Emojis = Spice, Not Sauce: Use sparingly and only when aligned with message tone.
 Email Body Optimization
Front-load the Offer: Lead with the deal and a short sentence on why it matters.
Visual Hierarchy: Make CTA buttons and key offers prominent.
Trim the Fat: Avoid long intros, repeated headers, or padded formatting that adds no value.
Consistency: Reinforce the subject line offer inside the body‚Äîensure what was promised is the focal point.
 Top 5% Performing Subject Line vs Bottom 5 percentile
Top 5% Performing Subject Line:
"9 Shop by Pieces 11.04"
üìà Why it may have performed well:
Action-Oriented: Begins with a verb ‚Äî "Shop" ‚Äî prompting engagement.


Personal Relevance: ‚ÄúShop by Pieces‚Äù implies customization or control, which is attractive.


Time-Sensitive: Includes a date (11.04), which may imply urgency or recency.


Specificity: Suggests a clear theme or feature of the campaign.
 Bottom 5% Performing Subject Line:
"December 2023 Image Survey"
üìâ Why it likely underperformed:
Low Emotional Appeal: ‚ÄúSurvey‚Äù is generally low-engagement unless incentivized.
Lacks Urgency or Benefit: Doesn‚Äôt tell the user what they gain by opening.
Too Formal/Neutral: Sounds more like internal communication or research rather than a promotional email.
No Call to Action: Passive tone with no compelling hook or verb to drive interaction.
Top 5 percentile performing email body vs bottom 5
If we pair this with previous analysis (Top vs Bottom 25%), we know that
 top-performing bodies:
Get to the point quickly
Use bold, action-driven CTAs (like "Shop Now")
Highlight specific value or savings
Reinforce the subject line message visually and textually
Short, engaging lines
Whereas bottom performers:
Bury the value or CTA
Use too much whitespace padding
Provide less visual contrast for CTAs
Offer vague or unconvincing messaging
